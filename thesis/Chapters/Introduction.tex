\label{Introduction}
Since the 1920's, accelerator physics research is rapidly advancing, and with it so is high-energy physics.
Starting with the first accelerating structures, which could accelerate particles to no more than a few hundred \si{\keV}, the reach to higher and higher center-of-mass energies requires new inventions in the field of particle accelerators and colliders.
Along with this goes the development of particle detectors, which need to adapt to the increasingly demanding environments of particle collisions that are created by the high-performing colliders.
Due to this fast progress, high-energy and accelerator research efforts and scientific breakthroughs can benefit also other areas, such as the development of new sensor technologies for mobile phones or new materials for the aerospace industry.
\\In the field of particle physics, discoveries of new particles and measurements of their characteristics have given explanations and insights to some of the key questions of humanity about the composition of matter, the fundamental forces that dictate our lives, and about the beginning of the universe.

The International Linear Collider is a proposed linear electron positron collider designed for
high-energy physics experiments at the precision frontier.
