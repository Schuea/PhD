\label{Introduction}
Since the 1930's, accelerator physics research is rapidly advancing, and with it so is high-energy physics.
Starting with the first 
pioneering 
The International Linear Collider is a proposed linear electron positron collider designed for
high-energy physics experiments at the precision frontier.
