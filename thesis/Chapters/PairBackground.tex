\chapter{\positron\electron pair background as the largest background contribution}
\label{PairBkg}

\begin{chapterabstract}
 At the International Linear Collider, the collisions of electron and positron beams are accompanied by the production of background particles.
 Unlike at hadron colliders, the main background contribution does not arise from QCD processes and underlying events, but rather from the interaction of the colliding beam's electromagnetic fields.
 The created secondary \positron\electron pairs form a significant background, the so-called pair background, for the inner detectors, and therefore need to be studied in great detail.
 This chapter discusses the effect of the ILC beam parameters on the pair background, and the impact of the \positron\electron pairs on the \sid detector.
\end{chapterabstract}

As discussed in Section~\ref{BeamBeam}, the pair background is a high cross section process from beam-beam interactions and the main source of background at the ILC.
The secondary electrons and positrons show a characteristic density distribution, which reach to the inner layers of the \sid vertex and tracking detectors.
The impact on the \sid detector is studied with respect to the timing, the hit distribution, and the arising detector occupancy.
These impacts are, however, dependent on the ILC beam parameters.
For the proposed change in the beam parameters for the ILC stage at \SI{250}{\GeV}, the effect on the pair background has been analyzed in detail. \todo{English}
The results of these studies, which is explained throughout the following sections, are essential for the design choices of the accelerator and the \sid detector.

\section{The background generator GuineaPig}
\label{PairBkg:GuineaPig}
For studying the effects of the pair background, \positron\electron pairs from beam-beam interactions were generated with the Monte Carlo (MC) background event generator \guineapig~\cite{Schulte:1997nga} version 1.4.4. 
When providing the accelerator beam parameters, the pair background events of one bunch crossing are simulated and stored in an ASCII output file.
The parameters used for generating the pair background for this thesis are given in Appendix~\ref{Appendix:Pairs:GuineaPig}. 
\\Since the ASCII files cannot directly serve as input to a full \geant~\cite{geant_ref,geant_ref2} detector simulation, a conversion tool was developed for the analysis studies presented in this thesis, and instructions on its usage are available in~\cite{Confluence}. 
The tool converts the ASCII output to one of the following common file formats: stdhep or slcio~\cite{LCIO}.
These file formats are directly applicable with the \geant based simulation tool \slic~\cite{Graf:2006ei}, which simulates interactions of the input particles with matter.
The geometry of the simulated world is described in a lcdd file in a human-readable format.
The flexible geometry description allows the simulation of particle interactions with individual detector geometries.
To this end, the geometry description file ``sidloi3'' of the \sid detector, which was used for the simulation studies in this and in the following chapters, is based on the detector design described in Section~\ref{ILC:SiD} and in~\cite[p. 69 ff]{TDR4}.

\section{Pair background characteristics}
\label{PairBkg:helix}
Analyzing the generated pair background events, it becomes apparent that the \positron\electron pairs have a low transverse momentum.
Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:Momentum} shows the distribution of their longitudinal and transverse momentum for the two ILC stages at \SI{250}{\GeV} and \SI{500}{\GeV} center-of-mass energy.
The longitunal momentum of the \positron\electron pairs reaches roughly \SI{80}{\percent} of the beam energy, whilst the transverse momentum extends to only \SI{0.8}{\GeV} for the ILC250, and \SI{1.6}{\GeV} for the ILC500.

   \label{fig:PairBkg:Momentum}
 \end{figure}
\\Due to their low transverse momentum, the pairs are deflected on helical tracks in the magnetic field of the detector solenoid magnet.
An algorithm was written that calculates the helix tracks of the pair particles using their four-vectors.
The track positions are computed from the radius of the helix, its center position and its pitch. The following assumptions were made for the algorithm:
The magnetic field in the proximity of the IP is homogeneous, with a field strength of \SI{5}{\tesla} for the SiD solenoid.
The particle momenta do not change in the region of interest for this analysis, because of which the helix radius is constant.
Any particle interaction with other particles or with matter is not taken into account.
\\Figure~\ref{fig:helix_circle} shows schematically the projection of a helix onto the xy-plane.
The orientation of the helix is determined by the particle's charge.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Figures/Pairs/Helix_explanation.png}
    \caption[Schematic projection of the helix on the xy-plane]{
    This schematic shows the projection of a helix track onto the xy-plane, with the vector of the transverse momentum (P\textsubscript{T}) and the the x- and y-momenta (p\textsubscript{x} and p\textsubscript{y}).
    Depending on the particle's charge, the direction of the rotation is either clockwise or anticlockwise.
    The center, the radius, and the orientation of the projected circle is dependent on the transverse momentum of the particle.
    }
    \label{fig:helix_circle}
\end{figure}
The pair density is then plotted using the helix track algorithm to calculate the position in x and y for a given position in z.
For the ILC stage at \SI{500}{\GeV}, the pair background was generated with \guineapig, and its density plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:Density} (a).
The density distribution of all the tracks shows a characteristic bell shape, with the highest density along the z-axis.
Since the bell shaped envelope is fully symmetrical in the positive and negative z-direction, as well as in the xz and yz-plane, the chosen view of the pair background envelopes will always be of the xz-plane in positive z-direction.

   }
   \label{fig:PairBkg:Density}
 \end{figure}
\\In order to compare the envelope shapes for different ILC beam parameters, Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:Density} (b) only shows the envelope outlines containing a certain fraction of all tracks.
In this way, it becomes apparent that for higher center-of-mass energies the width of the envelope increases due to the higher transversal momenta of the pairs.
At \SI{500}{\GeV}, the envelope containing \SI{99.99}{\percent} of all pair helix tracks crosses the beam pipe, extending towards the innermost layer of the SiD vertex detector, which has a radius of \SI{14}{\milli\meter}.
For lower center-of-mass energies, the envelopes stay within the beam pipe radius.
The pair background simulation files for this comparison plot were generated with \guineapig as well, using the beam parameters of the three different baseline ILC stages~\cite[p. 11]{TDR1}.

\section{Impact of the pair background studies on ILC design choices}
\subsection{Pair background dependency on ILC beam parameters}
As explained in Section~\ref{ILC:layout:staging}, the first ILC stage will be at \SI{250}{\GeV} instead of the originally anticipated \SI{500}{\GeV}.
Due to this decision in 2017, efforts have been made to study a possible change in the baseline beam parameters for this stage in order to increase the luminosity from \num{8.2} to \SI{16.2e34}{\per\centi\meter\squared\per\second}~\cite{LCWS17_paper}. 
To this end, three alternative beam parameter sets have been suggested, which vary from the original baseline parameters in the emittance and the beta function values.
The values which differ are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ILC250_sets}.
For all alternative sets, the horizontal emittance $\epsilon_x$ is reduced. 
Additionally, the horizontal and vertical beta functions at the IP, $\beta^*_x$ and $\beta^*_y$, are changed for sets (B) and (C).
Since both the emittance and the beta function are dependencies of the beam size, they enter indirectly the Equation~\ref{eq:luminosity} for the beam luminosity.
\\On the other hand, a reduced horizontal emittance implies also an increase in the beam-beam interactions and in the pair background level.
For the process of deciding the new official beam parameter set, a study of the impact of this increased pair background on the \sid vertex detector performance was therefore a crucial step.
In the following, the simulation studies of the pair background for the four parameter schemes listed in Table~\ref{tab:ILC250_sets} are presented.
\begin{table}[h]
\caption[New ILC250 beam parameters]{Changes between the baseline and alternative beam parameter sets for the ILC stage at \SI[detect-all]{250}{\GeV}~\cite{LCWS17_paper}.

 (C) & 5.0 & 9.19 & 0.58\\
\hline\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
\\Again, for the comparison of the pair background density from different ILC running scenarios, a two-dimensional plot of the track densities is not suitable.
Instead, Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:Density_Projection} shows a projection of the number of pair particles along the x-axis at the position in z, where the background envelopes are the largest compared to the beam pipe radius.
It therefore holds more information than the previous plots: the envelope width in x at the specified z-position, and the number of particles at any given x value, for all beam parameter sets.
\\First of all, it becomes clear that the number of pair particles does indeed increase for the new beam parameter sets due to the enhanced beam-beam interactions.
Compared to the baseline set (the TDR set), the number of particles in set (A) is increased by a factor of 2-3, and by a factor of 6-7 in sets (B) and (C).
Furthermore, the so-called pair edge is clearly visible as the rapid decrease in density at around \SI{9}{\milli\meter} from the center.
Since the pink vertical lines in the picture represent the beam pipe, the pair edge is well contained within the beam pipe.
Nevertheless, there are background levels observed outside the beam pipe, extending beyond the vertex detector layers.
These levels, however, are below 5 particles per x-position.
With the track information across the five layers of the vertex detector, the vertices of particles created in the bunch collision can be reconstructed.
By populating the innermost layers with background particles, the reconstruction efficiency inevitably declines.
The occupancy from the pair background therefore has to be studied with respect to its impact on the detector performance.

    The pink vertical lines represent the beam pipe radius at this z-position.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Occupancy studies and buffer depth}
\label{PairBkg:occupancy}
For the vertex detector occupancy studies, the number of hits of every detector cell is counted and translated into an occupancy.
In the following occupancy plots, the number of cells receiving a certain number of hits can be determined.
Knowing that a detector sensor can only store up to a specific number of hits (the so-called buffer depth), the number of ``dead'' cells can then be calculated.
A cell is defined to be dead when the buffer of its sensor is already completely filled, and no further hits can be stored.
This is especially important as the detectors for the ILC will read out their buffers only after every bunch train (1312 bunch crossings).
In order to guarantee that cell buffers are not filled only by background hits, a balance has to be found between a sufficient buffer depth and low background levels dependent on the design of the accelerator and the detectors.
In SiD, a rough estimate for an acceptable occupancy for background events is that the sum of all cells with a number of hits greater than or equal to the buffer depth should not exceed \SI{0.01}{\percent} (\num{e-4} of all cells). 
\\Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy} shows the occupancy for all vertex barrel detector layers combined after a full bunch train.
For producing these plots, pair background simulation files for 1312 bunch crossings have been generated with \guineapig, and the number of hits were counted for each cell, summed up over the full bunch train.
A cell size of \SI{20}{\micro\meter}\,x\,\SI{20}{\micro\meter} has been assumed for these calculations.
Plotting the number of cells with a certain amount of hits, and normalizing these numbers by the total number of cells in all vertex detector layers, results in Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy} (a).
It can be directly seen which percentage of all cells get hit a certain number of times.
Comparing the results from the four different ILC250 beam parameter sets, the occupancy of set (A) is raised by a factor of 3 with respect to the baseline set (TDR).
For set (B) and (C), the occupancy is increased by a factor of about 6.
\\Since the readout design for the vertex detector is not yet decided, optimizations based on simulation recommendations can still be made.
In Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy} (b), the number of dead cells are therefore plotted as a function of the assumed buffer depth of the sensors.
The buffer depth states how many hits a sensor can store, before the according cell is blind to any further hits.
The number of these dead cells is calculated from the occupancy plot in Figure ~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy} (a), and depends on the buffer depth.
In the current detector design, the sensors have a buffer depth of four. 
For this value, plot (b) shows that for set (A) \num{8e-6} of all cells in all vertex detector layers are dead, which is an increase with respect to the baseline set of a factor of four.
Nevertheless, \num{8e-6} is more than one order of magnitude below the critical limit of \num{e-4} of all cells, which was explained above.

   \label{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy}
 \end{figure}
\\However, combining the hits of all five vertex barrel detector layers does not provide a realistic picture of the occupancy in the innermost layer, which is expected to suffer from a larger pair background occupancy than the other layers.
Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy_Layer0} shows the normalized occupancy and the ratio of dead cells for the innermost vertex detector layer only.
In Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy_Layer0} (a), the normalized occupancy in all sets is larger by almost one order of magnitude compared to Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy} (a).
The number of dead cells for a buffer depth of four, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy_Layer0} (b), is now close to the critical limit of \num{e-4} of all cells.
For set (A), the ratio of dead cells for this buffer depth is about \num{4e-5}.
For sets (B) and (C), the ratio reaches about \num{8e-5} of all cells in this innermost layer.

   }
   \label{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy_Layer0}
 \end{figure}
Overall, the increase in the beam-beam interaction does lead to a rise in the SiD vertex detector occupancy.
However, even in the innermost vertex detector layer, the occupancy for all proposed beam parameter sets for the ILC250 stage are below the critical acceptance limit of \num{e-4} for every feasible buffer depth of the detector sensor design.
The presented results of the SiD occupancy studies for the different beam parameter sets of the ILC250 stage were factored into the ILC Change Request (CR) process for CR-0016.
The Technical Change and Management Board in the end decided on set (A) for the new official ILC beam parameter set for a center-of-mass energy of \SI{250}{\GeV}, and hence approved the CR-0016~\cite{LCWS17_TCMBmeeting,CR-0016}.
\\The results of further studies regarding the ILC250 stage are henceforth produced with this new official beam parameter set (A).
Thus, Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy_SetA} shows the results from two further ILC250 occupancy studies.
In Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy_SetA} (a), the SiD vertex detector occupancies from the pair background arising at a center-of-mass energy of \SI{250}{\GeV} and \SI{500}{\GeV} are compared.
With the new ILC250 beam parameter set, the resulting occupancies at both center-of-mass energies are very similar, with the occupancy at the ILC500 being higher on a few percent level.
This leads to the conclusion that the vertex detector readout architecture can be designed to be suitable for both ILC stages regarding the pair background.
\\Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy_SetA} (b) shows the effect of different SiD variants on the vertex detector occupancy at the ILC250.
The four geometry variants, which are compared in this plot, are combinations of the old or new L* value, with and without the SiD anti-DiD field.
For more information about these detector variants, please refer to Section~\ref{ILC:SiD}.
The variations on the SiD geometry do not have a significant impact on the vertex barrel occupancy.
Nevertheless, the SiD design including the old L* value and the anti-DiD field leads to the lowest occupancy.
The occupancy of the current design (with the new L* value and the anti-DiD field) is only marginally higher.
Since the geometry of the vertex detector and all other subdetectors is unaltered in the studied SiD variants, the difference in the pair background occupancy must be caused by the impact of the L* and the anti-DiD field themselves.
The change in the L* value implies a change in the position of the BeamCal subdetector.
The anti-DiD field is designed to guide the pair background particles through the outgoing beam pipe, so that the number of pair background hits in the BeamCal is reduced.
This is an indication that the SiD BeamCal affects the vertex detector occupancy from pair background particles.
For the clarification of the impact on the pair background occupancy, the following section looks at the hit distribution in the SiD detector.

\section{Hit maps of the SiD subdetectors}
\label{PairBkg:hitmaps}
%TODO Show with projection of hitmaps that there are more hits on edges of VertexBarrel detector (because of helix envelopes)
%TODO TH1D* histo=Layer_1->ProjectionX("ProjectionX",1,Layer_1->GetNbinsY(),"e")
As shown in the sections above, the \positron\electron pair background arises from beam-beam interactions at the IP.
Being boosted in the beam direction, and swept into the outgoing beam pipe by the anti-DiD, the hits in the SiD detector are mainly restricted to the inner subdetectors.
However, as indicated by Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:ILC250_Occupancy_SetA}, the SiD geometry variants have an impact on the vertex detector occupancy from the \positron\electron pairs.
\\Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:Origins_Map} shows maps of the pair background vertices in the SiD detector.
A cut was applied to only show the vertices of the pairs, which will hit the vertex detector in the given time intervals: up to \SI{10}{\nano\second} (Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:Origins_Map} (a)), and between \SI{20}{\nano\second} and \SI{30}{\nano\second} after the bunch crossing (Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:Origins_Map} (b)).
In this way, it becomes clear whether the background particles originate at the IP only, or whether they also backscatter from other subdetectors.
In the first \SI{10}{\nano\second}, the majority of particles, which hit the vertex detector, comes from the IP.
Also a few backscatter particles are visible, originating from the innermost detector layers and the central subdetectors.
A few nanoseconds later however, between \SI{20}{\nano\second} and \SI{30}{\nano\second}, particles hit the vertex detector, which were backscattered from the BeamCal positioned about \SI{3.2}{\meter} from the IP.
These pair background particles traveled from the IP towards the BeamCal, where they hit the material and backscattered back towards the vertex detector.
\\The distance from the IP towards the BeamCal and back, which the particles have traveled, takes of the order of several tens of nanoseconds.
This time gap is visible in Figure~\ref{fig:PairBkg:Hittime}, which shows the radial position of the hits in the vertex detector barrel and endcaps as a function of the hit time.
First, the vertex detector is hit by \positron\electron pairs arriving directly from the IP.
Before pairs have traveled towards the BeamCal and have backscattered, the vertex detector does not see any further hits.
Only from around \SI{20}{\nano\second} on, particles arrive again at the vertex detector.
Further details on this pair background timing study can be found at~\cite{SiDBkgNote}.
\\This hit time distribution offers the possibility of reducing the background occupancy through time gates.
Applying a trigger such that those particles are dismissed, which are hitting the vertex detector between \SI{10}{\nano\second} and \SI{50}{\nano\second} after the bunch crossing for example, the number of pair background hits can be reduced by about \SI{12}{\percent}~\cite[p. 27]{SiDBkgNote}.

\section{Conclusion}
The pair background arises from the interaction between the electromagnetic fields of the colliding beam bunches.
These interactions are dependent on the ILC beam parameters, which therefore affect the pair background characteristics.
This chapter has shown that the pairs, which originate from the IP as well as backscatter from the BeamCal, populate the inner SiD subdetectors.
Especially in the vertex detector, the impact of the beam parameters on the background becomes apparent, as the width of the pair background envelopes varies and the tracks of the pairs reaches towards the innermost vertex detector layers.
Here, the pairs cause a significant background occupancy, which was studied for various ILC stages and beam parameter sets.
These studies are a valuable input to design decisions regarding the ILC accelerator and the SiD detector, and were already consulted for the Change Request decision of the new beam parameters for the ILC stage at a center-of-mass energy of \SI{250}{\GeV}.
